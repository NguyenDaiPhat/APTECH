The Internet is a network of networks. That is, computer networks are linked to the ohter networks, spanning countries. The TCP/IP transfer protocol provides the bindings that connect all these computers the world over. <br>

A web pagr is not a printed page. That is, the guidelines that are applied to print may not apply to a web page. Avoid making the reader scan too much of the screen while reading the page. After a while it puts a strain on the eyes, and the reader may lose interest. Text should be contained within a few iches width.<br>
<a name="li"></a><h3 style="margin: 3px; margin-left: 0px;">Linear layout</h3>
Linear layout follows a linear structure. There is a sequential link between the pages. Each page has a link to the previous and next page. The last has a link to the first page. This fomat is used when you are require the user to read the information in sequential order.
<a name="pa"></a><h3 style="margin: 3px; margin-left: 0px;">Pathnames</h3>
Absolute pathnames specifi the complete path to the file from the root directory. For example, C:\mydirectory\htmlexamples\Doc2.htm.<br>
Relative pathnames specify the location of the file relative to the location of the current file. For example, if the current directory is my directory, then the pathname will be&#x3cA HREF="..\Doc3.htm">Next page&#x3c/A>
